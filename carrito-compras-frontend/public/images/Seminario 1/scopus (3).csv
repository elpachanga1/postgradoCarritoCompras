This paper presents an analysis of the relevant studies that addressed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cybersecurity generally, and in the aviation sector in particular, including identifying the most common increased cyber-attacks associated with the outbreak of COVID-19. Our analysis shows that commonly increased cyber-attacks associated with the outbreak of COVID-19 in aviation are phishing and ransomware. Furthermore, the likelihood of phishing and ransomware attacks is very likely during the pandemic than before it while the impact on flight operations is low, and the subsequent risk level is tolerable during the pandemic. Additionally, we propose a set of possible mitigation measures for those cyber-attacks.  © 2022 IEEE.","airlines; COVID-19; cyber resilience; cybersecurity; phishing; ransomware","Air transportation; Civil aviation; Crime; Malware; Network security; Aviation sector; Cybe resilience; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; Flight operation; Mitigation measures; Phishing; Risk levels; Cybersecurity","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The strengths and limitations of humans, who are integral parts of the system, are not always considered. Humans are cited as weakest part of security and risk management, and human errors are the primary contributor to data breaches, cyber-attacks, and ransomware attacks. In this study, we propose a product life cycle human-system interrelationship approach to discover risks that involve humans for providing insights into human-machine interaction design, training, and behavior-based risk mitigations to eliminate cybersecurity risk. We focus on tracing humans and subsystems that directly and indirectly impact how the product operates. After that, we can analyze the human-system interaction assumptions to discover opportunities for improving cybersecurity from human factors engineering viewpoint. These may include preventing unintended or undesirable actions, understanding workarounds, identifying opportunities to perceive and comprehend cyber-attack, improving the training and process development, and enhancing the risk management and improvement process. We use nuclear power plant computer-based procedures as an example to discuss how to trace through a product’s life cycle, find indirectly interrelated systems, and discover risks. The findings facilitate researchers' and practitioners' understanding of how humans may serve as the bridge between air gapped systems and finding ways to mitigate the impacts. This approach can let developers find opportunities to provide decision support tools, simplify processes, and efficiently use workforces. © 2023 American Nuclear Society, Incorporated.","computer-based procedure; cybersecurity; human-system interrelations; Product life cycle","Crime; Decision support systems; Human engineering; Life cycle; Malware; Network security; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Product design; Risk management; Computer-based procedure; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; Human-system interrelation; Human-systems; Integral part; Product life cycles; Risks management; System centric; Technologies and systems; Cybersecurity","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

To effectuate this, the space sector must increase awareness, adopt “security-by-design,” increase regulatory support, implement data security principles, and cooperate domestically and internationally. Given the growth in commercial space and satellite activity, the space sector has become even more vulnerable to cyber-attack. At the origin of computer networking, the corollary risk of network intrusion began. Given the prevalence of Internet use among the developed world, concerns about computer intrusions and hackers may be apparent to many in the general population. Within the technology sector, a more acute risk awareness and understanding exists. And, although intuitively it would be reasonable to expect those in the space sector to share this heightened perspective, reason does not always prevail. The absence of effective cybersecurity standards within the space and satellite sector reflects this disconnect. And yet, the risk of computer intrusions within the space sector and the potential harm to space operations could not be more pronounced. From both state and non-state actors, space operations serve an attractive target for cyber attacks. At an exploratory level, the intruder intent could be limited to traversing computer systems without any clear objective. At an informational level, the intruders (whether human or bot) might be focused on the acquisition of specific documents, knowledge, or state or trade secrets. However, certain documents could clearly lead to more menacing objectives. Beyond the foregoing, more nefarious players could seek to threaten operations on the International Space Station, disrupt human spaceflight, redirect satellites, or worse. In fact, akin to ransomware, these criminal operators could hold returned normality ransom in exchange for demands. To avoid or (at a minimum) minimize opportunities for intrusions, there is a need for awareness among and within the space industry, policy makers, and regulators. This paper and presentation will define space cybersecurity concerns and provide proposals for increased awareness. The paper will also provide an overview of cybersecurity efforts in the United States and internationally. We will propose specific principles directly related to the space sector as well as emphasize on the need for communication and cooperation across governments, commercial operators, and other NGOs.

This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the evolution of ransomware, its taxonomy, and its state-of-the-art research contributions. We begin by tracing the origins of ransomware and its evolution over time, highlighting the key milestones and major trends. Next, we propose a taxonomy of ransomware that categorizes different types of ransomware based on their characteristics and behavior. Subsequently, we review the existing research over several years in regard to detection, prevention, mitigation, and prediction techniques. Our extensive analysis, based on more than 150 references, has revealed that significant research, specifically 72.8%, has focused on detecting ransomware. However, a lack of emphasis has been placed on predicting ransomware. Additionally, of the studies focused on ransomware detection, a significant portion, 70%, have utilized Machine Learning methods. We further discuss the challenges found such as the ones related to obtaining ransomware datasets. In addition, our study uncovers a range of shortcomings in research pertaining to real-time protection and identifying zero-day ransomware. Adversarial machine learning exploitation has been identified as an under-researched area in the field. This survey is a constructive roadmap for researchers interested in ransomware research matters.

A major concern for such cyber-attacks is visual distraction inside the vehicle, which is one of the main causes of road accidents. In this empirical research using a driving simulator, 38 participants drove in a conditionally automated vehicle and experienced two types of failure: explicit (i.e., ransomware attack appearing on the in-vehicle screen) and silent (i.e., turn signals failed to activate on the in-vehicle screen and instrument cluster), while engaged in a non-driving related task. Drivers’ gaze behaviour, in terms of number and duration of fixation, were collected and analysed. Results showed that the HMI where the ransomware was displayed was the area of interest drivers looked at the most. The majority of drivers failed to notice that the turn signal was faulty. Nearly half of drivers looked at the ransomware for more than 12 s while driving. No effect on the timing of failure on gaze behaviour was observed. This research evidenced that ransomware attacks are distractive and pose significant risks to road safety – with one participant crashing the vehicle after resuming manual control. Data also evidenced that such connected vehicles are unlikely to meet NHTSA's distraction guidelines for safe use of in-vehicle devices. © 2023 The Author(s)","Automated driving; Cybersecurity; Distraction; Eye-tracking; Failure; Ransomware","Accidents; Automation; Crime; Cybersecurity; Eye tracking; Malware; Motor transportation; Network security; Vehicles; Automated driving; Automated vehicles; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; Distraction; Driver's behavior; Empirical research; Eye-tracking; Gaze behaviours; Visual distractions; Roads and streets","Article","Final","Scopus"

Cyberattacks, such as the 2017 NotPetya ransomware attack, the 2020 SolarWinds software supply chain attack and the 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack, illustrate the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to cyberattacks. Most cyberattacks are committed across borders involving criminal hackers or state supported hackers. Furthermore, critical infrastructure is increasingly interconnected and interdependent. Connectivity brings about the risk of a cyberattack, demonstrated by the 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack. Interconnectedness also means that the compromise of one critical infrastructure asset can have a domino effect that degrades or disrupts others and results in cascading consequences across the economy and national security. Operational continuity is essential and this may have been one of the reasons why Colonial Pipeline paid a ransom to cyber-attackers. A cyberattack on the critical infrastructure of a state cannot be seen in isolation as the consequences of the attack may impact other states, this was illustrated by the 2017 WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware attacks. The level of sophistication of cyberattacks has increased over the years as shown by the 2020 SolarWinds software supply chain attack. The escalation of attacks has served as a catalyst for governments to address the risk to critical infrastructure. Countries need to have strong government bodies which supervise cybersecurity in their country and work together with their counterparts in other countries by sharing information regarding threats and attacks against critical infrastructure. The discussion focuses on the challenges that threats to and attacks on critical infrastructure present, the possible solutions a government may implement in addressing cyberattacks on critical infrastructure and the accountability of state and non-state actors of cyberattacks on critical infrastructure. The issues are discussed from a legal perspective. © 2022 Curran Associates Inc..

The increasing machine connectivity and digitalization are leading to an increase in cybersecurity issues affecting ICS as these systems are updated to conform to the new Industry 4.0, IoT, and cloud computing infrastructure to achieve specific industrial goals. For this case study, we explore the threat posed by Ransomware-as-a-Service (RAAS) and the business model propagated by the criminal organization DarkSide for using RAAS to launch a cyberattack against the ICS of the Colonial Oil and Gas Company. The current approach of implementing a response after a cyber-attack prompted shifting to in-progress response mechanisms as cyber-attacks become more complex and time-consuming. Based on prior work by Lockheed Martin and Varonis, a new and improved Cyber Kill Chain Framework is proposed. This framework details the eight steps of a cyberattack: surveillance, intrusion, exploitation, privilege escalation, lateral movement, obfuscation/anti-forensics, denial of service, and exfiltration.

Therefore, people use social media to report and express their emotions about events they are experiencing. Furthermore, some officials take advantage of the popularity of social media to keep the public informed, especially during emergent events. Researchers have covered sentiment analysis on Twitter in many fields, such as movie reviews, stocks, politics, health, and sports. However, there is a research gap in studying the public's concerns on social media when a cybersecurity breach occurs and how people's sentiment changes over time. To fill the gap, The researchers selected the cyberattacks against Universal Health Services (UHS) during the late days of September 2020 and collected a large dataset of related tweets over five weeks. Live-streaming tweets and historical ones both were compiled. The focus while gathering tweets was in the context of cyberattacks on UHS using keywords and hashtags such as Universal Health System, UHS cyberattack, UHS Ransome, UHS security breach, and UHS locked. Then, the researchers determined tweets' sentiment classification on this developing event using deep learning of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and their accuracies. Furthermore, the researchers performed exploratory data analysis for the dataset supplying information about how sentiment has changed over time to compare the sentiment per week since the start of these cyberattacks on UHS.

Any organisation may face a number of challenges e.g. costly data breaches, ransomware incidents, and even litigation after an event. The Internet has, in many ways, changed society, transformed businesses, organisational communication and learning. People can now interact through social networking platforms. Modern society has become very technology driven, as ICT is now an integral component in peoples’ lives. However, besides the many benefits that the Internet and other ICT technology bring, there are also threats, such as cyber-attacks looking to exploit vulnerabilities in ICT applications and systems. This study is a systematic literature review that explores how societal impacts of cyber security in modern society are discussed in academic literature. The Introduction discusses the overall importance of cyber security in today’s society. The body of this paper presents the method in which the literature review was conducted, and a concise summary of the findings that answer the research question: How are societal impacts of cyber security discussed in academic literature? Six categories of investigation of societal impacts of cyber security are identified: 1) Impacts on Social and Societal Levels, 2) Detection of cyber-crime and incidents, 3) Critical infrastructures and services, 4) Impacts of incidents and individual technology, 5) Cybersecurity awareness, and 6) Cybersecurity and collaboration. Lastly, the conclusions, based on the research findings, address the feasibility, impact, strengths, weaknesses and possible ethical concerns of cybersecurity. This paper contributes to the overall understanding of current societal impacts of cyber security, and this understanding benefits the development of methods that assess societal impacts, as well as provides focus for future training and development of cyber and e-skills needed for better awareness of cyber threats, and to better address possible cyber incidents. © 2022 Curran Associates Inc..

Results show that with a single user prompt, malicious software such as DoS programs, spyware, ransomware, trojans, and wiperware can be created with ease. Furthermore, uploading the generated executables to VirusTotal revealed an average of 7/72 security vendors flagging the programs as malicious. This study has shown that novice programmers and script kiddies with access to Copilot can readily create functioning malicious software with very little coding experience. This paper discusses how this could potentially lead to an increase in internal attacks on schools due to the average age demographic of the target group.

With the increase in the number of internet of things (IoT) devices, security challenges in these devices, such as lack of encryption, malware, ransomware, and IoT botnets, leave the devices vulnerable to attackers that can access and manipulate the important data, threaten the system, and demand ransom. The lessons from the earlier experiences of cyberattacks demand the development of the best-practices benchmark of cybersecurity, especially in modern Smart Environments. In this study, we propose an approach with a framework to discover malware attacks by using artificial intelligence (AI) methods to cover diverse and distributed scenarios. The new method facilitates proactively tracking network traffic data to detect malware and attacks in the IoT ecosystem. Moreover, the novel approach makes Smart Environments more secure and aware of possible future threats. The performance and concurrency testing of the deep neural network (DNN) model deployed in IoT devices are computed to validate the possibility of in-production implementation. By deploying the DNN model on two selected IoT gateways, we observed very promising results, with less than 30 kb/s increase in network bandwidth on average, and just a 2% increase in CPU consumption. Similarly, we noticed minimal physical memory and power consumption, with 0.42 GB and 0.2 GB memory usage for NVIDIA Jetson and Raspberry Pi devices, respectively, and an average 13.5% increase in power consumption per device with the deployed model. The ML models were able to demonstrate nearly 93% of detection accuracy and 92% f1-score on both utilized datasets. The result of the models shows that our framework detects malware and attacks in Smart Environments accurately and efficiently. © 2023 by the authors.","artificial neural network; cybersecurity; internet of things; IoT security; machine learning; malware and attacks","","Article","Final","Scopus"

Ransomware attacks have become a global incidence and the most destructive cyber menace. As a popular example of cryptovirology, ransomware attacks typically encrypt files on a target computer and threaten to publish or permanently prevent access to the victim's data unless a ransom is paid. In general, ransom demands are often made in cryptocurrency to obscure transactions and maintain anonymity. Nonetheless, paying the ransom does not guarantee data recovery; and therefore, there is a strong need to develop alternative data recovery strategies. To build and implement proper data recovery procedures, it is necessary to analyze ransomware and identify its characteristics. In this paper, we first provide a review of ransomware types and common data recovery methods. Then, we propose a novel ransomware detection and data recovery framework to effectively retrieve data from infected files. Specifically, we investigate the notorious WannaCry malware and analyze its execution on a Windows virtual machine. We conduct digital forensics using the Autopsy tool to recover WannaCry-infected data and demonstrate the practicality of the proposed framework. Our framework can be applied to develop effective data recovery methods for WannaCry and other ransomware variants with similar behavior.  © 2023 IEEE.","cryptovirology; cyber forensics; data recovery; encryption; Ransomware","Computer forensics; Cybersecurity; Electronic crime countermeasures; Malware; Recovery; Cryptovirology; Cyber forensics; Cyber-attacks; Data connectivity; Data recovery; Data recovery procedures; Digital technologies; Recovery methods; Recovery strategies; Target computers; Cryptography","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Recently, Asian hospitals have become targets of numerous cyberattacks. While Western countries like the United States have implemented security-related laws, policies, standards, and other protective measures to deal with the healthcare cyberattacks, Asian countries are lagging. The Healthcare insurance portability and accountability act (HIPAA), enacted by the United States federal government, is a classic example of a law that has been in existence for a quarter-century now. Awareness about electronic health records (EHR) and their importance is increasing in Asia. Many hospitals and healthcare systems successfully implement solutions to protect healthcare data, including sensitive patient data. However, protecting healthcare data involves a sophisticated technology and compliance-driven approach due to the high value associated with the data. In this research, an earnest attempt is made to investigate the recent cyberattacks in Asian healthcare institutions. Based on the investigation, five types of cyberattacks are found to dominate Asian healthcare institutions. A detailed analysis of these attacks, their vulnerabilities, and associated risks are performed as a part of this study. In many countries with higher cybersecurity maturity, risk frameworks are successfully employed to manage the risks associated with healthcare data. In this study, the cyberattacks on Asian healthcare institutions are also analyzed through the lens of the National Institute of standards and technology (NIST) risk framework. Based on the literature review, a few unique recommendations are included in this research study to be used as risk mitigation measures by Asian healthcare organizations and researchers to manage and improve the growing situation of cyberattacks.  © 2013 IEEE.","Cyberattacks; data breach; healthcare; malware; ransomware; risk; risk management; vulnerability; vulnerability management","Cybersecurity; Data privacy; Health care; Hospital data processing; Hospitals; Malware; Risk assessment; Cyber-attacks; Data breach; Healthcare institutions; National Institute of Standards and Technology; Protective measures; Risk frameworks; Risks management; Vulnerability; Vulnerability management; Western countries; Risk management","Article","Final","Scopus"

Hackers nowadays are becoming increasingly smart. Instead of attacking big multi-national companies, international banks and government organisations which have built strong protection against cyber threats, the perpetrators now placed their focus on smaller and medium size businesses like technology start-ups through a variety of attacks from phishing, ransomware to the exploitation of vulnerabilities in the web or mobile applications. Therefore, it is imperative that technology start-ups have the capability in assessing their cyber security maturity to combat against cyber threats. However, for technology start-ups, it is especially imperative as cyber-attacks or data breaches could undeniably result in the loss of customers' confidence, regulatory implications and revenue loss which could eventually result in the start-up untimely closure. Although there are available security frameworks commonly used in the industry by cyber security practitioners, these frameworks are not suitable for technology start-ups as they tend to be broad and generic, taking a long time to conduct the assessment requiring adequate manpower or even the need for a budget to hire external consultants to help in conducting the assessment. This study seeks to analyse the current cyber security frameworks and introduce an end-to-end Cyber Security Maturity Model, which can be used specifically for technology start-ups. The proposed model not only provides an end-to-end maturity assessment of the start-up's cyber security posture but also coupled with an existing quantification model to justify the investments allocated in implementing cyber security measures for the start-up. Right-sizing the cyber security measures for the start-up in the different stages of the start-up lifecycle could allow reasonable controls to be implemented at the appropriate phase.  © 2022 IEEE.","cyber resilience; cyber resilience maturity assessment; cyber risk quantification; cyber security framework; cyber security maturity; return of security investment; Technology start-up","Budget control; Economics; Life cycle; Malware; Network security; Personal computing; Risk assessment; Cybe resilience; Cybe resilience maturity assessment; Cybe risk quantification; Cybe security framework; Cybe security maturity; Cyber security; Maturity assessments; Return of security investment; Risk quantification; Securities investments; Security frameworks; Technology start-up; Cybersecurity","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

In particular, this research-in-progress paper aims to explore the feasibility of using neutralisation theory to better understand one of the key stakeholders in ransomware operations: the offenders. Individuals (including offenders) may employ techniques of neutralisation in order to justify their rule-breaking acts, and to diminish both the perceived consequences of their acts and the feeling of guilt. The focus of this work is on highly organised ransomware groups that not only conduct cyber attacks but also operate Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) businesses. Secondary data was used in this research, including media interviews with alleged ransomware offenders. Data analysis is currently ongoing, but preliminary results show that ransomware offenders mainly use six neutralisation techniques to minimise the perceived impact and/or guilty feeling of their actions. These six neutralisation techniques are (1) denial of victim, (2) denial of injury, (3) claim of benefits, (4) claim of entitlement, (5) defence of necessity, and (6) claim of relative acceptability. The findings from this work can shed some light on the ransomware offending pathways, which in turn can be utilised to devise more effective countermeasures for combatting ransomware crime.  © 2023 IEEE.","countermeasures; neutralisation theory; ransomware crime","Cybersecurity; Malware; Network security; Breakings; Countermeasure; Cyber-attacks; Neutralisation; Neutralization theory; Ransomware crime; Secondary datum; Service business; Crime","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Cybercriminals inevitably adapt to new security technologies and utilize these platforms to exploit vulnerabilities for nefarious purposes, such as stealing users’ sensitive and personal data. This may result in financial losses, discredit, ransomware, or the spreading of infectious malware and other catastrophic cyber-attacks. Due to the fact that ransomware encrypts user data and requests a ransom payment in exchange for the decryption key, it is one of the most devastating types of malicious software. The implications of ransomware attacks can range from a loss of essential data to a disruption of business operations and significant monetary damage. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques, namely machine learning (ML), have proven to be notable in the detection of Android ransomware attacks. However, ensemble models and deep learning (DL) models have not been sufficiently explored. Therefore, in this study, we utilized ML- and DL-based techniques to build efficient, precise, and robust models for binary classification. A publicly available dataset from Kaggle consisting of 392,035 records with benign traffic and 10 different types of Android ransomware attacks was used to train and test the models. Two experiments were carried out. In experiment 1, all the features of the dataset were used. In experiment 2, only the best 19 features were used. The deployed models included a decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), ensemble of (DT, SVM, and KNN), feedforward neural network (FNN), and tabular attention network (TabNet). Overall, the experiments yielded excellent results. DT outperformed the others, with an accuracy of 97.24%, precision of 98.50%, and F1-score of 98.45%. Whereas, in terms of the highest recall, SVM achieved 100%. The acquired results were thoroughly discussed, in addition to addressing limitations and exploring potential directions for future work. © 2023 by the authors.","android security; cyber-attacks; deep learning; ensemble learning; machine learning; ransomware attacks","Android (operating system); Crime; Cryptography; Cybersecurity; Decision trees; Deep learning; Feedforward neural networks; Learning algorithms; Losses; Malware; Mobile security; Nearest neighbor search; Network security; Sensitive data; Statistical tests; Support vector machines; aluminum glycinate; Android securities; Cyber-attacks; Deep learning; Ensemble learning; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Ransomware attack; Supervised machine learning; Support vectors machine; Traffic analysis; article; artificial intelligence; attention network; binary classification; commercial phenomena; cyberattack; decision tree; deep learning; feed forward neural network; human; identifiable information; k nearest neighbor; learning; machine learning; malware; ransomware; supervised machine learning; support vector machine; theft; traffic; vulnerability; Learning systems","Article","Final","Scopus"

With the rising technology, Fintech has become a modern phenomenon. Financial organizations deal with highly confidential and sensitive information, including personal and financial data, all of which are the primary target of cybercriminals. Users and other stakeholders are massive in number, and many are not concerned about security, so they often find themselves as victims. The result of the study shows that from the perspective of Bangladesh, most of the attacks on the fintech industry are generated using ransomware and social engineering methods. It also shows that app-based Mobile Financial System (MFS) is the most affected sector in the financial system. The study provides a comprehensive framework, FinSec, which refers to the financial Security Framework to protect from cyber-attacks targeting any financial organization. It covers recommendations for regular end-users and anybody working in the financial sector. It also provides an architecture based on Consortium Blockchain, Hyper-ledger Fabric in a hybrid cloud to ensure a high level of security at the application level. Additionally, the framework proposes newer Three-Way Authentication (3WA) and Gamification to protect end-users. The research emphasizes ensuring a minimum level of training, as even after ensuring everything, massive damage can occur for the simplest mistake of the individuals related to the industry. To protect the financial system, from end-users to employees and user applications to the whole infrastructure, everything, and everyone should be secured. The framework hence recommends three subunits - Action, Knowledge, and Simulation Unit. These subunits protect the respective sector and, finally, end up protecting the fintech organizations.  © 2022 IEEE.","Blockchain; Cyber Threat; Cyberattack; Cybersecurity; Financial Scam; FinTech; Framework; Hyperledger Fabric; MFS; Prevention; Social Engineering","Blockchain; Crime; Distributed ledger; Finance; Malware; Network security; Block-chain; Cyber security; Cyber threats; Cyber-attacks; Financial scams; Financial system; Framework; Hyperledg fabric; Mobile financial system; Prevention; Social engineering; Cybersecurity","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Consequently, auditing of information systems has emerged as a crucial security apparatus for organizations aiming to safeguard their data assets, specifically with respect to customer information. This study aims to design an information systems security and audit model that emphasizes the fortification of an organization's crucial assets via IT infrastructure security and information security management systems, in alignment with ISO 27001 standards. The proposed model seeks to assure information confidentiality, integrity, availability, and compliance with legal mandates. The study adopted the OCTAVE v2.0 method, executed in three distinct phases. In the first phase, profiles of asset-based threats were constructed. The second phase involved the identification of infrastructure vulnerabilities, whereas the final phase focused on the development of a security strategy and plans. The implementation of the proposed model yielded a marked impact, with a positive shift from 46% to 94% following the establishment of IT infrastructure security policies. The study underscores the importance of conducting a comparative analysis prior to implementation and asserts that well-defined and identified security models and information systems auditing can effectively counteract potential data leaks and cyber-attacks such as malware, phishing, spam, and ransomware. The findings suggest that a meticulous and preemptive approach to auditing and security planning can significantly bolster the resilience of an organization's digital infrastructure. © 2023 WITPress.

As adversaries evolve, there is a growing need for fast, targeted defenses that effectively guard computer systems against these cyber-attacks. Cyber-deception is an increasingly adopted defense strategy with its ability to continually engage with adversaries and deploy counter-measures proactively by manipulating the malware program execution flow to non-useful states for the attacker. This paper introduces Mayalok, a novel hardware-based cyber-deception framework to combat malware through runtime instruction infusion. Mayalok employs hardware deception primitives to transparently insert or skip malware program instructions during runtime and deliver the attackers a deceptive view of the system state.

Cybercriminals constantly adapt to new security technologies and use URLs to exploit vulnerabilities for illicit benefits such as stealing users’ personal and sensitive data, which can lead to financial loss, discredit, ransomware, or the spread of malicious infections and catastrophic cyber-attacks such as phishing attacks. Phishing attacks are being recognized as the leading source of data breaches and the most prevalent deceitful scam of cyber-attacks. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have proven to be infallible in detecting phishing attacks. Nevertheless, sequential ML can be time intensive and not highly efficient in real-time detection. It can also be incapable of handling vast amounts of data. However, utilizing parallel computing techniques in ML can help build precise, robust, and effective models for detecting phishing attacks with less computation time. Therefore, in this proposed study, we utilized various multiprocessing and multithreading techniques in Python to train ML and DL models. The dataset used comprised 54 K records for training and 12 K for testing. Five experiments were carried out, the first one based on sequential execution followed by the next four based on parallel execution techniques (threading using Python parallel backend, threading using Python parallel backend and number of jobs, threading manually, and multiprocessing using Python parallel backend). Four models, namely, random forest (RF), naïve bayes (NB), convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) were deployed to carry out the experiments. Overall, the experiments yielded excellent results and speedup. Lastly, to consolidate, a comprehensive comparative analysis was performed. © 2023 by the authors.","cyber-attacks; deep learning; machine learning; parallel processing; phishing attacks","Crime; Cybersecurity; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Losses; Malware; Network security; Sensitive data; Statistical tests; Comparative analyzes; Cyber-attacks; Deep learning; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Parallel machine; Parallel processing; Phishing; Phishing attacks; Webs services; article; artificial intelligence; controlled study; convolutional neural network; cyberattack; deep learning; Internet; machine learning; phishing; random forest; ransomware; security; short term memory; theft; vulnerability; Python","Article","Final","Scopus"

Often, phishers discuss these attack vectors in dark forums. Further, the probability of phishing attacks and the subsequent loss suffered by the firm are highly correlated. In this context, we propose a hybrid framework using explainable AI techniques to assess cyber-risks generated from correlated phishing attacks. The first phase computes the probability of expert phishers within a community of similar attackers with varying expertise. The second phase calculates the probability of phishing attacks upon a firm even after it has invested in IT security and adopted regulatory steps. The third phase categorises phishing and genuine URLs using various machine-learning-based classifiers. Next, it estimates the joint distribution of phishing attacks using an exponential-beta distribution and quantifies the expected loss using Archimedean Copula. Finally, we offer recommendations for firms through the computation of optimal investments in cyber-insurance versus IT security. First, based on the risk attitude of a firm, it can use this explainable-AI (XAI) framework to optimally invest in building security into its enterprise architecture and plan for cyber-risk mitigation strategies. Second, we identify a long-tail phenomenon demonstrated by the losses suffered during most cyber-attacks, which are not one-off incidents and are correlated.

Most of these attacks were executed as a type of ransomware attack and cyber-attack. There are different methods performed by attackers to target individual user, but to breach an organization, they use Botnet forces. A botnet (robot network), is malware infected network that is controlled by a single attacker called bot-herder. Cyber-attacker attacks many users with their malware script by different mediums like emails, spams and takes command and control (CC) of the victim device. Using these devices attacker forms a network and performs large attack like distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), attack on an organization to breach data. The complex analysis for cybersecurity analyst is to find bot-herder and the infected network. The structures of the botnets are become very different now days. Botnets can be found with its peer-peer (p2p) structure, signature detection, behavioral analysis, domain names (DNS) and network traffic. To make this different feature analysis easier, the usage of artificial intelligence (AI) is introduced in cyber security. Data from previous attacks are collected, trained using a model which helps in prediction of future attacks. Detection of DNS of core CC servers using AI are widely used nowadays. This research mainly focuses on detection of botnet malware from the net flows of malware packets. The botnet attack data set are collected from resources like Czech-university (CTU-13), Information security and object technology (ISOT). The bi-directional net flow data and the calculation of the network packets are used. Using algorithms like support vector machine (SVM), decision tree and multi-layer perceptron, the data set is trained and tested. After the training and testing, the decision tree model has good accuracy and performance metrics of 92%. This model is considered as a best fit model and helps in detection the of malware packets. The research's objective is to build an alerting system which reports once a malware packet is intruded into a network. © 2023 The Authors.

Ransomware being a major threat to the security of digital information has now started to shake the economy of nations along with the disruption of essential needs. In the past few decades, there is a tremendous spike in the usage of ransomware for infecting critical infrastructures like hospitals and nuclear power plants causing the services to be encrypted and locked out. Ransom demands are made in huge amounts to obtain the decryption key and to restore the services. Since the discovery of the first ransomware in 1989, the financial loss it has created till now has been tremendous and continues to grow at an exponential rate. Alarmingly, ransomware has changed its pace from a malicious program to a perfect weapon to carry out cyber warfare across the world. Therefore, understanding the latest ransomware trends and securing the data from a ransomware attack is crucial in the current world.

More specifically, INTERPOL reported a substantial increase in ransomware attacks on healthcare institutions at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. This increase can be attributed to the rise in the adoption of digital technologies, such as the Medical Internet of Things (MIoT), to support healthcare services. The sensitive nature of healthcare data and the volume of data handled by healthcare institutions make them attractive to cybercriminals. When compared to financial data, healthcare data has more value on the dark web. Because a cyberattack on healthcare data could have far-reaching consequences, healthcare institutions should have effective strategies to safeguard unauthorized access. This paper presents the results of a systematic literature review (SLR) that investigated the strategies that can be used to mitigate cybersecurity threats to healthcare data. Forty-one research papers retrieved from three databases were analyzed based on specific inclusion/exclusion criteria. Synthesis of the sources yielded three main themes, namely, (i) emerging technology trends that contribute to cybersecurity vulnerability in the healthcare sector, (ii) current cybersecurity challenges in the healthcare sector, and (iii) cybersecurity countermeasures and mitigation strategies. The research results showed that a holistic approach that incorporates people, technology and adherence to regulations is required to mitigate cybersecurity threats in the healthcare sector.

Traditional ways to handle cyber incidents in healthcare organizations follow a predefined incident response (IR) procedure. However, this procedure is usually reactive, missing the opportunities to foresee danger on the horizon. Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) contains information on emerging attacks and should be ideally utilized to inform the IR procedure. However, current research shows that the IR has not been effectively informed by CTI, especially in healthcare organizations. This paper fills in this gap by proposing a proactive IR response procedure based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) IR methodology. This paper then presents the NHS WannaCry case study to demonstrate the use of the proposed IR methodology. We collate cyber security advisories from different CTI sources such as US/UK CERT to protect interconnected systems and devices from Ransomware attacks. This research provides novel insights into the IR in healthcare through embedding CTI advisories into IR processes and concludes that our proposed IR procedure can be used to counteract WannaCry Ransomware using CTI advisories. It has the significance of transforming the way of IR from reactive to proactive using the CTI in healthcare.

The suggested model takes a new approach by combining deep learning architectures and anomaly detection methods to detect both established and previously unexpected network intrusions. The study draws on a variety of datasets, including network traffic and security records, and employs thorough data preparation and feature engineering procedures. The accuracy of three important algorithms is rigorously compared Random Forest, and Logistic Regression K-nearest Neighbors. The findings of this study highlight the clear edge of K-nearest Neighbors in terms of overall better performance and technique and analysis. This paper contributes to network security by proposing a comprehensive model tailored to the complexities of Defense Area Networks, hence increasing the resistance against network breaches. In the modern interconnected digital environment, the susceptibility to network breaches is particularly pronounced. These breaches, often referred to as cyberattacks or data breaches, undermine the security of information confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility by unauthorized entry into systems, networks, or private data repositories. Cybercriminals deploy a diverse array of sophisticated techniques, encompassing malicious software, phishing, ransomware, and social manipulation, to infiltrate corporate networks and abscond with sensitive data.

Human errors, limitations, and weaknesses contribute to data breaches, ransomware attacks, and cyber-attacks. The cybersecurity community struggles to leverage human factors as a scientific discipline to eradicate human-related issues. Problems regarding the human element in cybersecurity require curricula focusing on the scientific aspects of human factors to teach human factors principles. As people and technology are increasingly interdependent, students interested in pursuing careers in technology must have a foundational understanding of people and their interactions with technology. While human factors is the discipline, human factors engineering is the work of leveraging human factors principles to improve the integration between humans and systems. Through various venues, educational initiatives, and research, academia can systematically link the science of human factors with cybersecurity. Colleges and universities are a centric node to educate industry, academia, and government leaders on the value of human factors engineering in cybersecurity. Through scholarly research, partnerships with government and industry, and a developing human factors curriculum, academia can influence business decision-makers to leverage human factors engineering with the same rigor and affinity for cybersecurity, software, and network engineering.

However, traditional training methods, such as phishing awareness campaigns, training videos and assessments have proven to be less effective over time. Therefore, it is time to rethink the approach on how to train cyber awareness. In this paper we suggest an alternative approach – a serious game – to educate awareness for common cyberattacks. While many serious games for cybersecurity education exist, all follow a very similar approach: showing people the effects of a cyber attack on their own system or company network. For example, one of the main tasks in these games is to sort out phishing mails. We developed and evaluated a new type of cybersecurity game: an attack simulator, which shows the entire setting from a different perspective. Instead of sorting out phishing mails the players should write phishing mails to trick potential victims and use other forms of cyberattacks. Our game explains the intention of each attack and shows the consequences of a successful attack. This way, we hope, players will get a better understanding on how to detect cyberattacks. © 2023, EasyChair.

However, the secrecy surrounding cyber attacks and how organizations manage their cyber resilience make it impossible for stakeholders to develop this understanding. This paper analyzes organizational cyber resilience, its contextual factors and its impact on the outcomes of cyber attacks based on publicly available data. Using the PRISMA methodology, we collated and analyzed a dataset of 1,145 publicly known cyber attacks. We conceptualize and operationalize cyber resilience from a governance perspective. Our findings indicate that organizations that suffered cyber attacks had the following cyber resilience characteristics: a relatively low level of cyber resilience reflected in the low frequency of cybersecurity roles, low reliance on cybersecurity frameworks, and relatively low strength of prevention, detection, and recovery controls. Cyber resilience is found to be associated with the sector, size, and digital intensity. Linear regression indicates that, expectedly, stronger prevention, detection, and recovery processes are related to lower breach severity and occurrence of investigations or penalties, but contrary to expectations, cybersecurity roles and frameworks are not. Furthermore, better organizational responses are associated with higher breach severity but they are not found to have an impact on the level of investigations, fines, and penalties imposed.

It makes the victims' resources unusable by encrypting data or locking systems to extort ransom payments. Ransomware has variant families that continue to evolve. Moreover. cybercriminals use advanced techniques to develop ransomware, making it harder for anti-malware detection systems to detect them. Ransomware solutions need the capabilities of timely and effective detection and response to discover uncommon behavior before losing sensitive data. Cyber threat hunting (CTH) is a novel proactive malware detection approach that includes cyber threat intelligence (CTI) methods and data analysis methods. However, most present CTH solutions depend on internal data sources and reactive techniques to detect unusual activities. An effective CTI technique is required to obtain knowledge from external data sources and combine it with internal sources to enhance the hunting capabilities. Then, using the optimal data analysis technique is needed for the CTH approach to obtain valuable insights into abnormal patterns in running activities in the early stages. In this study, we investigate using a practical CTI approach and different CTH models. Subsequently, we discussed ransomware research directions to detect known and unknown ransomware attacks. Also, we discussed the available ransomware datasets used in present ransomware studies. © 2013 IEEE.","cyber threat hunting; cyber threat intelligence; deep learning; machine learning; malware analysis; Ransomware","Behavioral research; Cryptography; Cybersecurity; Deep learning; Information analysis; Internet of things; Locks (fasteners); Malware; Network security; Behavioral science; Cybe threat hunting; Cybe threat intelligence; Cyber threats; Deep learning; Machine-learning; Malware analysis; Soft sensors; Support vectors machine; Support vector machines","Article","Final","Scopus"

This paradigm can impact our lives while also providing significant economic benefits. However, although resource-constrained IoT devices offer numerous advantages, they are also vulnerable to cyberattacks. As a result, ransomware severely threatens IoT devices managing sensitive and relevant information. Solutions based on Machine and Deep Learning (ML/DL) that consider behavioral data have been identified as promising. However, most detection solutions have been developed for Windows-based systems, which generally have more resources than IoT devices. As a result, these solutions are not suitable for resource-constrained components. In addition, no solution compares the pros and cons of different behavioral dimensions of resource-constrained devices. Thus, this work presents a framework that combines three different behavioral sources with supervised and unsupervised ML/DL algorithms to detect and classify heterogeneous ransomware impacting resource-constrained spectrum sensors. A pool of experiments has demonstrated the suitability of the proposed solution and compared its performance with a rule-based system. In conclusion, the usage of resources combined with local outlier factor and decision tree are the most promising combinations to detect anomalies and classify ransomware while consuming CPU, RAM, and time of devices in a reduced manner. © 2023 The Author(s)","Cybersecurity; Fingerprinting; Machine learning; Ransomware","Decision trees; Deep learning; Internet of things; Palmprint recognition; Behavioral data; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; Economic benefits; Fingerprinting; Machine-learning; On-machines; Resourceconstrained devices; Window-based systems; Windows-based systems; Malware","Article","Final","Scopus"

When such cyber attacks occur, e.g. a ransomware outbreak, it is desirable to quickly respond by containing the threat or limit its consequences. Technologies that support this process have been widely used for decades, including antivirus software and deep-packet inspection firewalls. A large number of researches on cyber security have been initiated to automate the incident handling process further, often motivated by the need to respond to more advanced cyber attacks or the increasing cyber risks at stake. This paper reviews the research on automatic incident response solutions published since the year 2000, in order to identify gaps as well as guide further research. The proposed solutions are categorized in terms of the input they use (e.g. intrusion signals) and the output they perform (e.g. reconfiguring a network) using the D3FEND framework. The solutions presented in 45 papers published in the academic literature are analyzed and compared to four commercially available solutions for automatic response. Many of the 45 papers described input and output in vague terms. The most common inputs were from asset inventories, platform monitoring and network traffic analysis. The most common output was network isolation measures, e.g. to reconfigure firewalls. Commercially available solutions focus more on looking for identifiers in reputation systems and individual analyzing files. © 2023 Owner/Author.","D3FEND; Intrusion response; review","Computer system firewalls; Computer viruses; Crime; Network security; Antivirus softwares; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; D3FEND; Deep packet inspection; Exposed to; Handling process; Incident response; Input and outputs; Intrusion response; Cybersecurity","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Nevertheless, the use of intelligent agents in cybersecurity needs to be more extensive. Recently, most research in cybersecurity has focused more and more on detecting malicious activities automatically. Unfortunately, few works focused on how the human factor can result in such attacks. Human-induced attacks and errors are found to be either unintentional or intentional. The first type, our focus, can result from lacking training and cyber awareness. Attackers use different tactics to lure victims into unsafe behaviors, leading to potential personal blackmail, ransomware attacks, or data breaches through phishing emails. Usually, to address the problem mentioned above, universities, employers, and organizations provide cyber awareness education. However, the problem is that the training is a one-time process and does not provide the necessary continuing support and education. As a result, people usually find themselves in a situation where they need specific advice before engaging in a particular activity. Sometimes, they might need someone to alert them to a suspicious email, fishy link, or abnormal attachment. In response, in this study, we discuss the integration of chatbots with social networking for cybersecurity public awareness, education, and workplace training. We focus on utilizing chatbots as social, collaborative agents to protect users against cyber-attacks. The chatbots provide continuous support to users by providing immediate answers and advice on what to do in various threatening situations. In addition, admin users add training material remotely into chatbots, and users can view and answer interactive questions to ensure they are up-to-date regarding cyber awareness. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial Intelligence; Chatbot; Cybersecurity Awareness; Social Network Analysis; Workplace Training","Computer crime; Cybersecurity; Intelligent agents; Network security; Social networking (online); Banking customers; Chatbots; Customer-service; Cyber security; Cybersecurity awareness; E- commerces; Education training; Malicious activities; Social Network Analysis; Workplace training; Electronic mail","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Such malicious software programs come under different classifications, namely Trojans, viruses, spyware, worms, ransomware, Rootkit, botnet malware, etc. Ransomware is a kind of malware that holds the victim's data hostage by encrypting the information on the user's computer to make it inaccessible to users and only decrypting it; then, the user pays a ransom procedure of a sum of money. To prevent detection, various forms of ransomware utilize more than one mechanism in their attack flow in conjunction with Machine Learning (ML) algorithm. This study focuses on designing a Learning-Based Artificial Algae Algorithm with Optimal Machine Learning Enabled Malware Detection (LBAAA-OMLMD) approach in Computer Networks. The presented LBAAA-OMLMDmodelmainly aims to detect and classify the existence of ransomware and goodware in the network. To accomplish this, the LBAAA-OMLMD model initially derives a Learning-Based Artificial Algae Algorithm based Feature Selection (LBAAA-FS) model to reduce the curse of dimensionality problems. Besides, the Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA) with Echo State Network (ESN) Classification model is applied. The FPA model helps to appropriately adjust the parameters related to the ESN model to accomplish enhanced classifier results. The experimental validation of the LBAAA-OMLMD model is tested using a benchmark dataset, and the outcomes are inspected in distinct measures. The comprehensive comparative examination demonstrated the betterment of the LBAAAOMLMD model over recent algorithms. © 2023 CRL Publishing.

Law enforcement should focus on investigating and disrupting those cybercrimes that are relatively more frequent, all else being equal. Similarly, firms should account for the likelihood of different forms of cyber incident when tailoring risk management policies. This paper reviews the quantitative evidence available for both cybercrime victimi-sation and cyber risk likelihood, providing a bridge between the academic fields of criminology and cybersecurity. We extract estimates from 48 studies conducted by a mix of academics, statistical institutes, and cybersecurity vendors using a range of data sources including victim surveys, case-control studies, and the insurance market. The victimisation estimates are categorised into: cyber attack; malware; ran-somware; fraudulent email; online banking fraud; online sales fraud; unauthorised access; Denial of Service; and identity theft. For each category, we display all estimates in the years 2017-2021. Our review shows: (i) firms face higher victimisation rates than individuals, which increases in the number of employees; (ii) global surveys reveal a consistent relative ranking of countries in ransomware victimisation; (iii) although trends could be identified within studies that collect longitudinal data, these trends tended to contradict each other when compared across studies; and (iv) broad categories with unclear consequences (e.g. malware and fraudulent emails) displayed higher variance and average values than categories associated with specific outcomes (e.g. identity theft or online banking fraud).

Cyber-attacks can hit an organization hard by causing several damages such as data breach, financial loss, and reputation loss. Some of the most prominent examples of ransomware attacks in history are WannaCry and Petya, which impacted companies’ finances throughout the globe. Both WannaCry and Petya caused operational processes inoperable by targeting critical infrastructure. It is quite impossible for anti-virus applications using traditional signature-based methods to detect this type of malware because they have different characteristics on each contaminated computer. The most important feature of this type of malware is that they change their contents using their mutation engines to create another hash representation of the executable file as they propagate from one computer to another. To overcome this method that attackers use to camouflage malware, we have created three-channel image files of malicious software. Attackers make different variants of the same software because they modify the contents of the malware. In the solution to this problem, we created variants of the images by applying data augmentationmethods. This article aims to provide an image augmentation enhanced deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models for detecting malware families in a metamorphic malware environment. The main contributions of the article consist of three components, including image generation from malware samples, image augmentation, and the last one is classifying the malware families by using a CNN model. In the first component, the collected malware samples are converted into binary file to 3-channel images using the windowing technique. The second component of the system create the augmented version of the images, and the last part builds a classification model. This study uses five different deep CNNmodel formalware family detection. The results obtained by the classifier demonstrate accuracy up to 98%, which is quite satisfactory.

While research in malware detection can be partially adapted for ransomware, specific ransomware infection patterns can be leveraged to improve the detection efficiency. In this paper, we focus on identifying vulnerable targets in ransomware attacks, aiming to accelerate the ransomware detection process as well as enable better data backup policies design. Specifically, we make three contributions. First, we characterize lexical features and hierarchical file structure features on those ransomware infected files and folders. Second, we model the data backup as an attributed tree graph, learn a new feature representation of the nodes with graph neural networks, and train a classifier based on the new features. Third, with real-world snapshot backup instances, we demonstrate the superior performance of the graph representation learning based approach over several baselines. Compared to the traditional full-scan approaches, our finding suggests that the vulnerable ransomware attack target identification can result in a more efficient ransomware detection process via focused inspection of most vulnerable data in the backups. Our method can also be easily integrated into existing ransomware detection systems for accelerated cyber resiliency. © 2022 IEEE.","classification; data backup; graph neural networks; ransomware attacks; representation learning","Cybersecurity; Graph neural networks; Malware; Network security; Trees (mathematics); Cloud adoptions; Data backups; Detection process; Digitisation; Graph neural networks; Graph representation; Ransomware attack; Representation learning; Target's identifications; Work-flows; Classification (of information)","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Recently, several studies have been conducted to prevent further phishing emails in the workplace because malware attacks employ emails as the primary means of penetration. However, according to the latest research, there appears to be a limitation in blocking email spoofing through advanced blocking systems such as spam email filtering solutions and advanced persistent threat systems. Therefore, experts believe that it is more critical to restore services immediately through resilience than the advanced prevention program in the event of damage caused by malicious software. In accordance with this trend, we conducted a survey among 100 employees engaging in information security regarding the effective factors for countering malware attacks through email. Furthermore, we confirmed that resilience, backup, and restoration were effective factors in responding to phishing emails. In contrast, practical exercise and attack visualization were recognized as having little effect on malware attacks. In conclusion, our study reminds business and supervisory institutions to carefully examine their regular voluntary exercises or mandatory training programs and assists private corporations and public institutions to establish counter-strategies for dealing with malware attacks. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

The rapid expansion of cyber-insurance in recent years hints the strong demand for cyber-insurance and its benefits. However, the impacts of cyber-insurance practice on cybersecurity enhancement and cyber-attackers are largely unknown. In this paper we study the optimal cybersecurity investment and cyber-insurance decision-making systematically with special attention paid to the effects of the attacker’s strategies. The economic modeling analysis and simulation study suggest that although cyber-insurance may be beneficial for the insured from a financial perspective, cyber-insurance practice may not be optimal from the societal cybersecurity perspective. Purchasing cyber-insurance decreases organizations’ optimal cybersecurity investment and increases the attacker’s expected payoffs. Therefore, the attacker has a motive to manipulate cyber-insurance by selective cyber-attacks on organizations up to a critical point, beyond which we discovered that imposing further threat will force organizations to invest more in cybersecurity. The attacker is capable of “playing god” by controlling the probabilities of initiating cyber-attacks and acts strategically to influence organizations’ incentives to whether to purchase cyber-insurance to harvest benefits. This study of cyber-insurance’ effects on attackers and their strategic manipulation of cyber-insurance provides insights for the future of the cyber-insurance market. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","attacker manipulation; cyber-insurance; cybersecurity investment; economic modeling and analysis; game theory; pricing","Costs; Crime; Cybersecurity; Decision making; Economic analysis; Financial markets; Game theory; Insurance; Malware; Network security; Attacker manipulation; Cybe-insurance; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; Cybersecurity investment; Economic models; Economics analysis; Insurance policies; Modelling and analysis; Rapid expansion; Investments","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Criminals use this type of cyber attack to lock or encrypt victims' data, often coercing them to pay exorbitant amounts in ransom. The damage ransomware causes ranges from monetary losses paid for ransom at best to endangering human lives. Cryptographic ransomware, where attackers encrypt the victim's data, stands as the predominant ransomware variant. The primary characteristics of these attacks have remained the same since the first ransomware attack. For this reason, we consider this a key factor differentiating ransomware from other cyber attacks, making it vital in tackling the threat of cryptographic ransomware. This paper proposes a cyber kill chain that describes the modern crypto-ransomware attack. The survey focuses on the Encryption phase as described in our proposed cyber kill chain and its detection techniques. We identify three main methods used in detecting encryption-related activities by ransomware, namely API and System calls, I/O monitoring, and file system activities monitoring. Machine learning (ML) is a tool used in all three identified methodologies, and some of the issues within the ML domain related to this survey are also covered as part of their respective methodologies. The survey of selected proposals is conducted through the prism of those three methodologies, showcasing the importance of detecting ransomware during pre-encryption and encryption activities and the windows of opportunity to do so. We also examine commercial crypto-ransomware protection and detection offerings and show the gap between academic research and commercial applications. © 2023 The Author(s)","Crypto-ransomware; Cybersecurity; Encryption; Kill-chain; Ransomware; Survey","Crime; Cyber attacks; Malware; Network security; Crypto-ransomware; CryptoGraphics; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; Digital life; Encryption detections; Human lives; Key factors; Kill chain; Machine-learning; Cryptography","Article","Final","Scopus"

Although they are tightly interconnected, it is difficult to evaluate their degree of interdependence. Keeping up with the pace of technology can be a challenging task, mainly when updating the hardware and software infrastructure. Every day, corporations and governments are faced with this issue; most have been victims of cyber attacks, security breaches, and data leaks. The consequences are significant in monetary losses; damage remediation is unattainable, even impossible, in certain circumstances. The repercussions might include reputational damage, legal responsibility, and threats to national security (when attacks are carried out against critical infrastructures to control the resources of a country), to name a few. Similarly, data has become such an integral part of many industries that it is one of the most critical targets for attackers that often is encrypted by ransomware, stolen, or corrupted. Without data, many companies are not able to continue operating as they do. The combination of all these factors complicates the ability of organizations to cooperate, trust, and share information in efforts to research and develop solutions for industry and government.This work proposes a Blockchain-based infrastructure solution provided by 'Hyperledger Fabric' technology for companies to securely transmit and share information using the latest encryption and data storage technologies operating on the model of distributed systems and smart contracts. By presenting unique digital assets as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), the infrastructure is able to trust the integrity of the data, while protecting it from counterfeiting. Through the use of a Blockchain-based file storage system known as IPFS, and by connecting all the relevant elements together through a web-based application, it is possible to demonstrate that the implementation of such systems is feasible, highly scalable and a useful tool that many organizations can utilize to create new work systems and worktflows for digital asset management.  © 2022 IEEE.","blockchain; Digital Ownership; Hyperledger Fabric; IPFS; NFT","Cryptography; Cybersecurity; Digital storage; Information dissemination; National security; Network security; Block-chain; Computational resources; Digital ownership; Global economies; Hardware and software; Hyperledg fabric; Internet resources; IPFS; Non-fungible token; Reward systems; Blockchain","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

There have been various reports of cyber incidents targeting the OT system. In 2019, Norsk Hydor was infected with particular ransomware worldwide through its corporate network, forcing the manufacturing site to operate manually. In May 2020, Taiwan's CPU, responsible for Taiwan's oil supply, was targeted by a cyber-attack. COTS (Commercial Off The Shelf, such as Windows OS, Intel PC, and open source applications) devices have been proposed to reduce the deploying OT system budget. Also, DX efforts are being made to shift from physical operation to virtual operation by using virtualization with IoT, AI, and Cloud. Due to this technological trend, the expanded attack surface is forced to manage the OT system as a ""Zero Trust System"" that assumes cyber-attacks. In IT systems, countermeasures such as whitelisting and firewalls prevent attackers from outside the system. For OT system, Network Security Zoning described in IEC62443 is recommended to mitigate the effects of cyber-attacks. However, attackers exist all over the world, and they are continually developing new attack methods. For this reason, the authors believe that it is impossible to prevent all attacks, no matter what measures the defenders take. Therefore, when responding to cyber-attacks against the OT system, it is essential to consider countermeasures by focusing on plant accidents caused by control system failures, most of which are assumed as safety measures. To ensure the plant's safety and continue the business operation even if it has a cyber-attack on the OT system, it is indispensable to develop human resources to respond to the incident flexibly.

Zero-day ransomware attacks try to exploit new vulnerabilities and are considered a severe threat to existing security solutions and internet resources. In the case of zero-day attacks, training data is not available before the attack takes place. Therefore, we exploit Zero-shot Learning (ZSL) capabilities that can effectively deal with unseen classes compared to the traditional machine learning techniques. ZSL is a two-stage process comprising of: Attribute Learning (AL) and Inference Stage (IS). In this regard, this work presents a new Deep Contractive Autoencoder based Attribute Learning (DCAE-ZSL) technique as well as an IS method based on Heterogeneous Voting Ensemble (DCAE-ZSL-HVE). In the proposed DCAE-ZSL approach, Contractive Autoencoder (CAE) is employed to extract core features of known and unknown ransomware. The regularization term of CAE helps in penalizing the classifier's sensitivity against the small dissimilarities in the latent space. On the other hand, in case of the IS, four combination rules Global Majority (GM), Local Majority (LM), Cumulative Vote-against based Global Majority (CVAGM), Cumulative Vote-for based Global Majority (CVFGM) are utilized to find the final prediction. It is empirically shown that in comparison to conventional machine learning techniques, models trained on contractive embedding show reasonable performance against zero-day attacks. Furthermore, it is shown that the exploitation of these core features through the proposed voting based ensemble (DCAE-ZSL-HVE) has demonstrated significant improvement in detecting zero-day attacks (recall = 0.95) and reducing False Negative (FN = 6). © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Autoencoder; Deep Learning; Ensemble Classification; Ransomware; Zero-day Attack; Zero-shot Learning","Cybersecurity; Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Malware; Zero-shot learning; Attack detection; Auto encoders; Core features; Cyber-attacks; Deep learning; Ensemble classification; Ensemble-classifier; Inference stages; Machine learning techniques; Zero day attack; Zero-day attack","Article","Final","Scopus"

Despite the conventional view of Windows-based systems as the most targeted by ransomware attacks, there has been a noticeable shift in focus towards Linux-based systems, posing a new security challenge. Linux, a widely adopted open-source operating system renowned for its robust security and dependability, has been particularly favored by critical infrastructures, government entities, and commercial enterprises. Nevertheless, the recent emergence of ransomware targeting Linux systems has exposed the platform's susceptibility to cyber threats, leading to heightened concerns about the security of these systems. This research article proposes a zero-trust resilience strategy (ZTRS) for Linux based servers and personal computers to effectively mitigate the latest crypto ransomware variants including Hive, Conti, Darkside, REvil and Red Alert. ZTRS adopts a comprehensive and advanced strategy that has been carefully designed to efficiently hinder the fundamental requirements that Linux ransomware relies on to execute its operations. It implements a range of preemptive measures to prevent any efforts by the ransomware to obtain root privileges, and to obstruct the extraction of data that could enable multi-level extortion. The tactics employed by ZTRS are highly effective in safeguarding against the devastating consequences of Linux ransomware attacks.  © 2023 IEEE.","crypto warfare; crypto-ransomware; cyber security; cyber-attack; Linux ransomware; malware; zero trust","Crime; Linux; Malware; Open systems; Personal computers; Crypto warfare; Crypto-ransomware; Cyber criminals; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; Linux ransomware; Malwares; Resilience strategy; Windows-based systems; Zero trust; Cybersecurity","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

There have been various reports of cyber incidents targeting the OT system. In 2019,Norsk Hydor was infected with particular ransomware worldwide through its corporate network,forcing the manufacturing site to operate manually. In May 2020,Taiwans CPU,responsible for Taiwans oil supply,was targeted by a cyber-attack. COTS (Commercial Off The Shelf,such as Windows OS,Intel PC,and open source applications) devices have been proposed to reduce the deploying OT system budget. Also,DX efforts are being made to shift from physical operation to virtual operation by using virtualization with IoT,AI,and Cloud. Due to this technological trend,the expanded attack surface is forced to manage the OT system as a ""Zero Trust System"" that assumes cyber-attacks. In IT systems,countermeasures such as whitelisting and firewalls prevent attackers from outside the system. For OT system,Network Security Zoning described in IEC62443 is recommended to mitigate the effects of cyber-attacks. However,attackers exist all over the world,and they are continually developing new attack methods. For this reason,the authors believe that it is impossible to prevent all attacks,no matter what measures the defenders take. Therefore,when responding to cyber-attacks against the OT system,it is essential to consider countermeasures by focusing on plant accidents caused by control system failures,most of which are assumed as safety measures. To ensure the plants safety and continue the business operation even if it has a cyber-attack on the OT system,it is indispensable to develop human resources to respond to the incident flexibly. For this reason,we had been developing cybersecurity exercises to acquire the meta-knowledge necessary to respond to cyber-attacks targeting the OT system.

As businesses virtually eliminated in-person experiences, the COVID-19 pandemic changed the way we live and caused a mass migration to digital platforms. However, this shift also made people more vulnerable to cyber-crime. Victims are being targeted by attackers for their credentials or financial rewards, or both. This is because the Internet itself is inherently difficult to secure, and the attackers can code in a way that exploits its flaws. Once the attackers gain root access to the devices, they have complete control and can do whatever they want. Consequently, taking advantage of highly unprecedented circumstances created by the Covid-19 event, cybercriminals launched massive phishing, malware, identity theft, and ransomware attacks. Therefore, if we wish to save people from these frauds in times when millions have already been tipped into poverty and the rest are trying hard to sustain, it is imperative to curb these attacks and attackers. This paper analyses the impact of Covid-19 on various cyber-security related aspects and sketches out the timeline of Covid-19 themed cyber-attacks launched globally to identify the modus operandi of the attackers and the impact of attacks.

Despite the plethora of potential benefits that have prompted their eventual introduction, AVs may also be a source of unprecedented disruption for future travel eco-systems due to their vulnerability to cyber-threats. In this context, this work assesses AVs' cybersecurity readiness. It establishes a Causal Loop Diagram (CLD) based on the System Dynamics approach: a powerful technique inferred from system theory, which can synthesise the behaviour of complicated AV systems. Based on the CLD model, three feedback loops and a system archetype 'Fixes-That-Fail' are envisioned, in which the growth in hacker capability, an unforeseen result of technology innovation, demands constant mitigation efforts. The most challenging aspect of this context is determining the trade-off between five components: i) the natural growth of AV technology; ii) stakeholders (communication service providers, road operators, automakers, AV consumers, repairers, and the general public) access to AV technology; iii) the measures to limit hackers' access to AV technology; iv) a pervasive dynamic strategy for circumventing hacker amplification; and v) the efficient usage of AV operating logfiles. © 2022 IEEE.","cyber-attack; cyber-physical system; driverless cars; privacy; ransomware; risk assessment; safety","Cybersecurity; Economic and social effects; Embedded systems; Personal computing; Risk assessment; Autonomous vehicle technologies; Autonomous Vehicles; Causal loop diagrams; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; Cyber-physical systems; Driverless cars; Privacy; Risks assessments; Malware","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

This paper focuses on precursors of email response in situations that can be the origin of cybersecurity incidents in organizations (i.e., phishing attacks, ransomware, etc.). This study explores participants' intentions to follow recommendations related to personal information handling when using email at work, attitudes towards and subjective norms relative those recommendations, and anticipated regret for ignoring secure recommendations. To capture the proposed factors, this study develops and tests a survey-based measurement.

It is also often referred to by its acronym, DL (AI). This technique lays an emphasis on the use of big capacity, scalable models that are able to construct distributed representations depending on the input data set. This proposed illustrates the generalizability of these methods and the usage of them in a broad range of cyber security investigations that are peculiar to their environment. The neural network models have been continuously refined and extended during the whole of this research in order to achieve greater adaptability. The following is a list of the important contributions that this proposed makes, in order from most significant to least significant: Work is currently being done to create a comprehensive database for the identification of domain names that have been generated by a domain generation algorithm (DGA), as well as a one-of-a-kind architecture that will increase the overall effectiveness of DGA domain name detection. Both of these will help increase overall efficiency.

The examination of information gathered from social media platforms, electronic mail (email), and uniform resource locators in order to design a unified, DL-based framework for the detection of spam and phishing (URL). The creation of a technique based on DL for the study of secure shell (SSH) traffic, the categorization of application network traffic, the classification of malicious traffic, and the detection of harmful traffic is being worked on. The name of the new framework that has been suggested, which is called ScaleMalNet, reflects how hybrid and scalable it is. In the first stage, the executables file is classified as malware or genuine by using static and dynamic analysis. In the second stage, the malicious executables le are grouped into corresponding malware families. This is a two-step process. For the aim of conducting investigations into Android ransomware and malware, an analogous hybrid DL framework is now in the process of being developed. This framework is better in its capacity to detect dangerous software and ransomware on Android when compared to the typical ML-based techniques that are presently in use.

Ransomware is a frequently used malware in cyber-attacks to trick the victim users to expose sensitive and private information to the attackers. Consequently, victims may not be able to access their data any longer until they pay a ransom for stolen files or data. Different methods have been introduced to overcome these issues. It is evident through an extensive literature review that some lexical features are not always sufficient to detect categories of malicious URLs. This paper proposes a model to detect Ransomware using machine and deep learning approaches. This model was introduced as a novel feature for classification using the idea that starts with “https://www.” This feature was not considered in the earlier papers on malicious URLs identification. In addition, this paper introduced a novel dataset that consists of 405,836 records. Two main experiments were carried out utilizing malicious URL features to defend Ransomware using the proposed dataset. Moreover, to enhance and optimize the experimental accuracy, various hyper-parameters were tested on the same dataset to define the optimal factors of every method. According to the comparative and experimental results of the applied classification techniques, the proposed model achieved the best performance at 99.8% accuracy rate for detecting malicious URLs using machine and deep learning. © 2022,International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

The IoHT is revolutionizing healthcare by enabling remote access to hospital equipment, real-time patient monitoring, and urgent alerts to patients and hospitals. However, the convenience of these systems also makes them vulnerable to cyberattacks, with hackers seeking to disrupt health services or extort money through ransomware attacks. Efficiently detecting multiple threats is a challenging task because IoHT generates large temporal data and system log information. In this paper, we propose time series classification models for the identification of potential cyberattacks in IoHT networks. First, we introduce Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA) with modifications of the regularization parameter to select the vital input features. With the selected features, we propose two LSTM-based models: Directed Acyclic Graph-based Long Short-Term Memory (DAG-LSTM) and Projected Layer-based Long Short-Term Memory (PL-LSTM) for detecting cyberattacks. We evaluate the existing time series classification models (i.e., GRU, LSTM, and Bi-LSTM) and proposed models (i.e., DAG-LSTM and PL-LSTM) using real-world IoHT data. We also validate the models by applying a non-parametric statistical test, Friedman test. Our evaluation results show that the proposed DAG-LSTM achieves the highest accuracy with 99.89% training and 92.04% an average testing accuracy.

The conducted security analysis proves the security of the proposed BSFR-SH against the ransomware attacks. The performance of BSFR-SH is significantly better than the other similar existing mechanisms as it achieves better accuracy and F1-score than other compared mechanisms. Furthermore, the practical demonstration of BSFR-SH is provided to estimate the impact on important performance parameters.  © 1975-2011 IEEE.","blockchain; intrusion detection; machine learning; Ransomware; smart healthcare","Blockchain; E-learning; Electronic mail; Health care; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Machine learning; Malware; Network security; Block-chain; Hard disc; Intrusion-Detection; Machine-learning; Malwares; Medical services; Security; Security frameworks; Smart healthcare; Cybersecurity","Article","Final","Scopus"

Despite decades of studies and experiences on this issue, there still exists a problem that we always pay great attention to technology while overlooking strategy. In the traditional warfare, the level of decision-making and the formulation of optimal strategies have a great effect on the warfare result. Similarly, the timeliness and quality of decision-making in cyber attack-defense also make great significance. Since the attackers and defenders are oppositional, the selection of optimal defense strategy with the maximum payoff is difficult. To solve this problem, the stochastic evolutionary game model is utilized to simulate the dynamic adversary of cyber attack-defense. We add the parameter \lambda to the Logit Quantal Response Dynamics (LQRD) equation to quantify the cognitive differences of real-world players. By calculating the evolutionary stable equilibrium, the best decision-making approach is proposed, which makes a balance between defense cost and benefit. Cases studies on ransomware indicate that the proposed approach can help the defender predict possible attack action, select the related optimal defense strategy over time, and gain the maximum defense payoff.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.","attack-defense; Cybersecurity; decision making; evolutionary game; LQRD; optimal defense strategy","Crime; Decision making; Intrusion detection; Malware; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Cyber security; Defense strategy; Evolutionary game models; Evolutionary games; Optimal decision making; Optimal strategies; Quantal response; Stable equilibrium; Network security","Article","Final","Scopus"

Cyber networks and platforms are prone to cyber attacks. The recent survey reveals that, 45% of cyber attacks has grew in the last 5 years. Identifying the threats like malware, ransomware and network breach is challenging, since the threats are hetrogenity in nature. Organizations are facing a daunting challenge of dealing with the millions of new attacks a day. Conventional security analysis fails to identify the threats due to the rapid development in new attacks and variants. Cyber Security may be measured and evaluated against multiple threats. While they are not the only method for securing, assessing the vulnerability and information leakage, automating the network security and platform play an integral role in the cyber space. Machine learning is a powerful technique to develop a system, which adapts to the data stream. In order to deal with huge volume of data more efficiently and precisely, machine learning algorithms will be used to distinguish threats and identifying the infected hosts. However, certain intrisic characteristics of machine learning algorithms makes the implementation more challenging. The agenda of the talk will be focused on the mitigation of cyber attacks with the help of machine learning approaches by automation. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","","Crime; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Malware; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; Cyberspaces; Data stream; Information leakage; Machine learning approaches; Security analysis; Network security","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

The users can allocate and free resources allocated for their Virtual Machines (VMs) as needed. However, with the rapid growth of interest in cloud computing systems, several issues have arisen especially in the domain of cybersecurity. It is a known fact that not only the malicious users can freely allocate VMs, but also they can infect victims' VMs to run their own tools that include cryptocurrency mining, ransomware, or cyberattacks against others. Even though there exist intrusion detection systems (IDS), running an IDS on every VM can be a costly process and it would require fine configuration that only a small subset of the cloud users are knowledgeable about. Therefore, to overcome this challenge, in this paper we present a VM introspection based allowlisting method to be deployed and managed directly by the cloud providers to check if there are any malicious software running on the VMs with minimum user intervention.

Ransomware is one of the types of malware which is the result of sophisticated attempt to compromise the modern computer systems. The governments and large corporations are investing heavily to combat this cyber threat against their critical infrastructure. It has been observed that over the last few years that Industrial Control Systems (ICS) have become the main target of Ransomware due to the sensitive operations involved in the day to day processes of these industries. As the technology is evolving, more and more traditional industrial systems are replaced with advanced industry methods involving advanced technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT). These technology shift help improve business productivity and keep the company's global competitive in an overflowing competitive market. However, the systems involved need secure measures to protect integrity and availability which will help avoid any malfunctioning to their operations due to the cyber-attacks. There have been several cyber-attack incidents on healthcare, pharmaceutical, water cleaning and energy sector. These ICS' s are operated by remote control facilities and variety of other devices such as programmable logic controllers (PLC) and sensors to make a network. Cyber criminals are exploring vulnerabilities in the design of these ICS's to take the command and control of these systems and disrupt daily operations until ransomware is paid.

Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) increases the possibilities to detect and prevent cyber-attacks and gives defenders more time to act. CTI is a combination of incident response and traditional intelligence. Intelligence modifies raw data into information for decision-making and action. CTI consists of strategic, operational, or tactical intelligence on cyber threats. Security event monitoring, event-based response, and anomaly and signature-based detection can create the basis of the situation in cyberspace. To achieve a uniform situational picture, long-term assessment is required. Strategic CTI informs broad or long-term issues and provides situation awareness as well as an analyzed overview of the threat landscape and early warning of cyber threats. This paper describes how the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) can be utilized in strategic CTI. The results were arrived at using the design science research methodology. We propose a solution that uses AI as a component of strategic CTI. Furthermore, the paper is a literature survey, integrating research literature on intelligence, cybersecurity, and AI. The paper presents the concept of CTI and its relation to the situational picture of cyberspace. It also addresses the possibilities of natural language understanding for large-scale content analysis and introduces a solution in which an existing enriched dataset provided valuable strategic-level information about an ongoing malicious cyber event.

Specifically, it creates a hostage-like situation in which the victim is threatened with the risk of data loss and forced into a negotiation.

A single attack (e.g., WannaCry ransomware attack) can cause as much as $4 billion in damage. However, the cybersecurity investment by companies is far from satisfactory. Therefore, governments (e.g., in the UK) launch grants and subsidies to help companies to boost their cybersecurity to create a safer national cyber environment. Computing the optimal allocation is challenging due to limited subsidies, the interdependence between companies and the presence of strategic cyber attackers. To tackle the government's allocation problem, we introduce a Stackelberg game model where the government first commits to an allocation and the companies/users and attacker simultaneously determine their protection and attack (pure or mixed) strategies, respectively. For the pure-strategy case, while there may not be a feasible allocation in general, we prove that computing an optimal allocation is NP-hard and propose a linear reverse convex program when the attacker can attack all users. For the mixed-strategy case, we show that there is a polynomial time algorithm to find an optimal allocation when the attacker has a single-attack capability. We then provide a heuristic algorithm, based on best-response-gradient dynamics, to find an effective allocation in general settings.

Because of the possible breaches in information security, it has become pertinent that organisations change organisational and individual cultures to become more secure. However, there are challenges regarding the implementation of these processes within organisations. Organisations have become dependent on information systems, which stores large quantities of data and can be considered as one of an organisation’s greatest assets. Whilst employees are considered as the next important asset, their negligence, whether intentional or not, and due to their possible lack of knowledge regarding information security, have also become one of the biggest threats to information security. Employees often fall victim to phishing scams, malware and ransomware attacks. Whilst many consider the implementation of information security awareness initiatives as a solution to this impending threat, more often than not organisations utilize presentations to address information security awareness training. This approach has not been successful as the target audience has difficulty in retaining the knowledge, and this often hinders its proper implementation. Change management not only involves the change in processes and tools but also focuses on the techniques used to manage the cultural change within organisations. This paper ‘encodes’ awareness training for information security and cyber security from a change management approach and provides best practice approaches in changing an organisation’s culture from an insecure culture to a secure one. © 2020 Curran Associates Inc..

State-linked cyber operations pose serious legal threats and challenges to the stability and security of cyberspace. The discussion aims to establish a legal understanding pertaining to the differences and similarities between state-linked cyber operations such as cyberattacks and malicious cyber activities. In many instances, the terms are used interchangeably. Conduct that may be considered as malicious activities are referred to as cyberattacks. However, cyberattacks and malicious activities are not the same and the consequences and motive for the state-linked cross-border cyber operation may differ. State-linked cyberattacks is defined as a cyber operation that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects such as DDoS attacks or ransomware attacks. State-linked malicious cyber activities consist of theft of information (espionage), disinformation and false websites. Malicious activities do not cause physical harm to persons or objects. However, the harm in the instance of espionage may consist of financial loss and/or undermining trust in the ability of the government to protect sensitive information or sowing political and social discord such as interference in another country’s elections or referendums. Cyber operations evoke various debatable questions such as how should a victim state respond to state-linked cyber operations and when does state behaviour in a foreign cyberspace constitute an act of cyber war or information war? Drawing a clear distinction is relevant when it comes to a victim state’s response to a foreign state’s cyber operation in their cyberspace on national, international and global level. Stability and security in cyberspace may be achieved by means of international norms governing state behaviour specifically cross-border cyber operations. Although a country should not abuse the cyberspace of another country, the discussion debates the negotiation and enforcement of cyber norms governing state behaviour and how countries should respond to unlawful cyber operations on national and global level. © 2019, Curran Associates Inc.

Along with other potential challenges across different domains, it has brought numerous cybersecurity challenges that must be tackled timely to protect victims and critical infrastructure. Social engineering-based cyber-attacks/threats are one of the major methods for creating turmoil, especially by targeting critical infrastructure, such as hospitals and healthcare services. Social engineering-based cyber-attacks are based on the use of psychological and systematic techniques to manipulate the target. The objective of this research study is to explore the state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice social engineering-based techniques, attack methods, and platforms used for conducting such cybersecurity attacks and threats. We undertake a systematically directed Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) related to the recent upsurge in social engineering-based cyber-attacks/threats since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 52 primary studies were selected from both formal and grey literature based on the established quality assessment criteria. As an outcome of this research study; we discovered that the major social engineering-based techniques used during the COVID-19 pandemic are phishing, scamming, spamming, smishing, and vishing, in combination with the most used socio-technical method: fake emails, websites, and mobile apps used as weapon platforms for conducting successful cyber-attacks. Three types of malicious software were frequently used for system and resource exploitation are; ransomware, trojans, and bots. We also emphasized the economic impact of cyber-attacks performed on different organizations and critical infrastructure in which hospitals and healthcare were on the top targeted infrastructures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lastly, we identified the open challenges, general recommendations, and prospective solutions for future work from the researcher and practitioner communities by using the latest technology, such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and big data analytics. © 2013 IEEE.","COVID-19; cyber-attacks and threats; Multivocal literature review; prospective solutions; security and privacy; social engineering","Advanced Analytics; Artificial intelligence; Critical infrastructures; Data Analytics; Economic and social effects; Health care; Hospitals; Infrastructure as a service (IaaS); Network security; Public works; Different domains; Healthcare services; Latest technology; Literature reviews; Quality assessment; Social and economic impacts; Social engineering; State of the practice; Malware","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, along with the incredible benefits and conveniences we have received new dangers and risks. Mankind is increasingly becoming hostage to information technology and cyber world. Recently, cybercrime is one of the top 10 risks to sustainable development in the world. It poses serious new challenges to global security and economy. The aim of the article is to obtain an assessment of some of the financial effects of modern IT crimes based on an analysis of the main aspects of monetary costs and the hidden economic impact of cybercrime. A multifactor regression model has been proposed to determine the contribution of the cost of the main consequences of IT incidents: business disruption, information loss, revenue loss and equipment damage caused by different types of cyberattacks worldwide in 2019 to total cost of cyberattacks. Information loss has been found to have a major impact on the total cost of cyberattacks, reducing profits and incurring additional costs for businesses. It was built a canonical model for identifying the dependence of total submission to ID ransomware, total cost of cybercrime and the main indicators of economic development for the TOP-10 countries. There is a significant correlation between two sets of indicators, in particular, it is confirmed that most cyberattacks target countries - countries with a high level of development, and the consequences of IT crimes are more significant for low-income countries. © 2021 IEEE.","cyber attack; cybercrime; econometric model; economic impact; hidden cost; monetary cost","Cost benefit analysis; Cybersecurity; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Malware; Regression analysis; Cyber-attacks; Cyber-crimes; Econometric modelling; Economic impacts; Financial effects; Global economies; Hidden costs; Information loss; Monetary costs; Technological progress; Crime","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Not all systems are adequately protected and even for those that are, individuals can still fall prey to cyber-attack attempts (e.g., phishing, malware, ransomware) that occasionally break through, and/or engage in other cyber risky behaviors (e.g., not adequately securing devices) that put even the most secure systems at risk. Such susceptibility can be due to one or a number of factors, including individual differences, environmental factors, maladaptive behaviors, and influence techniques. This is particularly concerning at an organizational level where the costs of a successful cyber-attack can be colossal (e.g., financial, safety, reputational). Cyber criminals’ intent on infiltrating organization accounts/networks to inflict damage, steal data, and/or make financial gains will continue to try and exploit these human vulnerabilities unless we are able to act fast and do something about them. Is there any hope for human resistance? We argue that technological solutions alone rooted in software and hardware will not win this battle. The ‘human’ element of any digital system is as important to its enduring security posture. More research is needed to better understand human cybersecurity vulnerabilities within organizations. This will inform the development of methods (including those rooted in HCI) to decrease cyber risky and enhance cyber safe decisions and behaviors: to fight back, showing how humans, with the right support, can be the best line of cybersecurity defense. In this paper, we assert that in order to achieve the highest positive impactful benefits from such research efforts, more human-centric cybersecurity research needs to be conducted with expert teams embedded within industrial organizations driving forward the research. This cannot be an issue addressed through laboratory-based research alone. Industrial organizations need to move towards more holistic – human- and systems- centric – cybersecurity research and solutions that will create safer and more secure employees and organizations; working in harmony to better defend against cyber-attack attempts. One such example is the Airbus Accelerator in Human-Centric Cyber Security (H2CS), which is discussed as a case study example within the current paper. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Cyber psychology; Cybersecurity; Human factors","Computer privacy; Crime; Human computer interaction; Industrial management; Industrial research; Network security; Environmental factors; Individual Differences; Industrial organization; Laboratory based research; Maladaptive behavior; Organizational levels; Software and hardwares; Technological solution; Malware","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"

Threats and methods of attack on cybersecurity at all times occur very quickly. Indonesia was attacked by 28,430,843 in 2015 and increased to 135,672,984 cyber attacks in 2016, and became the 10th largest country in the world with encryptor/ransomware malware infection in 2017. Previous studies have shown that national cybersecurity in Indonesia have not been properly managed. This can be shown from the lack of cooperation among government agencies, the lack of national strategies, governance, policies, and regulations on cybersecurity, and cyber security infrastructure in Indonesia are still not integrated with each other. The problems are caused by the absence of an organization that focuses on cybersecurity nationally. In 2017, the President of the Republic of Indonesia established the National Cyber and Crypto Agency as the government agency that responsible for handling national cybersecurity issues. This paper examines institutional structure and functions of National Cyber and Crypto Agency (BSSN) from the perspective of the regulation and BSSN opportunities in realizing the national cybersecurity demands in Indonesia. The analysis indicated clearly that BSSN has strengths in regulation, management, and technical fields as the organizer and provider of a national cybersecurity as well as strategic function to be the coordinator in realizing synergy among parties who have interests in national, regional and international cybersecurity system, so that BSSN can be relied upon to become the leading sector of national cybersecurity development in Indonesia. © 2018 IEEE.","BSSN; cyber attacks; cybersecurity","Chromium compounds; Computer crime; Crime; Malware; Network security; BSSN; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; Government agencies; Indonesia; Institutional structure; National strategies; Technical fields; National security","Conference paper","Final","Scopus"
